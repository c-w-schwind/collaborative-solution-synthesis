    "overview": "The space is divided into zones (collaborative, quiet, private) that shift based on time-of-day demand.",
    "description": "The co-working space is divided into different functional areas, which shift their usage rules throughout the day to accommodate varying work styles. The three core zone types are:\n\n- Collaborative Zones – Open areas meant for teamwork, brainstorming, and casual networking. Conversations, group work, and light noise are acceptable.\n- Quiet Zones – Designated spaces for deep work, where conversations and phone calls are discouraged. These are optimized for freelancers and remote workers who need focus.\n- Private Zones – Enclosed rooms for private meetings, calls, or high-concentration work. These rooms must be reserved in advance through the smart booking system.\n\nHow It Works:\n\n1. Time-Based Adjustments: Each zone has a default mode (e.g., collaborative during the morning, quiet in the afternoon) but can be adjusted based on real-time demand.\n2. Member Preferences: Users can indicate their workspace needs via a mobile app or kiosk, influencing the daily zoning schedule.\n3. Adaptive Layouts: Movable partitions and modular furniture allow for quick reconfiguration, ensuring flexibility in room setups.\n4. Live Zone Indicators: Digital displays and color-coded lighting indicate the current status of each zone to prevent confusion and enforce boundaries.\n\nKey Benefit: Ensures fair and efficient use of space without permanently restricting any area to a single function.",

Behavioral Guidelines & Notifications:\n- A noise awareness system with real-time noise level monitoring alerts members when their area is exceeding recommended decibel levels.\n- Screens or app notifications remind users to maintain appropriate noise levels based on the current zoning of the space.\n- 'Silent Hours' policies can be implemented in specific areas to ensure focused work periods.\n\n3. Noise-Preference-Based Desk Assignments:\n- Users can indicate their work style (social, mixed, or quiet), and the system suggests the best seating locations for them accordingly.\n- AI tracking ensures that loud users aren’t assigned to quiet zones unless necessary.\n\nKey Benefit: Prevents unnecessary distractions and friction while maintaining a flexible environment for both social and quiet workers.",
